**nba_history** is a python package for dynamically scraping NBA player, team, and draft data.

All nba_history functions return scraped data as a `pandas dataframe` with an option to also export to `CSV`.

## Example

```python
from nba_history import player_data, team_data

# scrape 2013 NBA draft picks
df = player_data.scrape_draft_data(start_year = 2013,
	end_year = 2013,
	export = False)
	
print(df.head())
```
